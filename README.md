Microsoft Excel doesn't get the kind of credit that it honestly deserves. This was a 2 AM happy me drunk idea, when I was feeling particularly adorbz towards Excel. 

Manufactured raw data which I think accurately models how one of my friend behaves, and then graphed them using MS Excel, because everyone around me had already dozed off. 

This is what 2 AM me thinks is funny. You will not find insights, good looking graphs or really anything of value in here.
