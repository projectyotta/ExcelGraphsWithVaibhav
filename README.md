# ExcelGraphsWithVaibhav

So I basically came up with some raw data about a friend of mine which I thought was a good idea, and made them into graphs. Everything has been done using MS Excel 2007. 

A bit about the friend : He heads marketing for Uber Vizag now, but him and me and a bunch of other friends of mine also have a three year old startup primarily into online portfolio management, UI and UX and explainer videos. This guy is the CEO !
