# ExcelGraphsWithVaibhav

Microsoft Excel doesn't get the kind of credit that it honestly deserves. This was a 2 AM happy me drunk idea, where my love for Excel was overflowing. 

Manufactured raw data which I think accurately models how one of my friend behaves, and then graphed them using MS Excel 2007.

A bit about the friend : He heads marketing for Uber Vizag now, but him and me and a bunch of other friends of mine also have a three year old startup primarily into online portfolio management, UI and UX and explainer videos. This guy is the CEO !
